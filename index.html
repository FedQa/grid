    <div>God made it rain, the devil made it hail
        Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
        Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
        Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town</div>
    <div>Элемент 6</div>
    <div>See this in 3D, all lights out for me
        All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
        Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
        Finally free, found the God in me
        And I want you to see, I can walk on water
        Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
        Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
        I know You won't</div>
